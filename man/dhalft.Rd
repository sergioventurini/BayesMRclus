\title{Half-t Distribution Density}
\usage{
dhalft(x, alpha = 25, nu = 1, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of quantiles. Typically non-negative; values
less than zero are allowed but correspond to the density of the underlying
Student-\eqn{t} distribution reflected at zero.}

\item{alpha}{A positive numeric vector giving the scale parameter.}

\item{nu}{A positive numeric vector giving the degrees of freedom.}

\item{log}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, probabilities are returned on the
log scale.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector giving the density (or log-density) evaluated at \code{x}.
The length of the result is the maximum of the lengths of
\code{x}, \code{alpha}, and \code{nu}; shorter arguments are recycled.
}
\description{
Computes the probability density function of the half-\eqn{t}
distribution.
}
\details{
The half-Student-\eqn{t} distribution is defined as the distribution of
\eqn{|T|}, where \eqn{T} follows a Student-\eqn{t} distribution with
\code{nu} degrees of freedom and scale parameter \code{alpha}.

The density is
\deqn{
f(x) = \frac{2}{\mathrm{\alpha}}
  \frac{\Gamma((\nu + 1)/2)}{\Gamma(\nu/2)\sqrt{\pi \nu}}
  \left(1 + \frac{1}{\nu}\left(\frac{x}{\mathrm{\alpha}}\right)^2\right)^{-(\nu+1)/2},
\qquad x \ge 0.
}
}
\examples{
x <- seq(0, 100, length.out = 100)
y <- dhalft(x, alpha = 25, nu = 5)
plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Half-t density")

# Log-density
dhalft(10, alpha = 25, nu = 1, log = TRUE)

}
