\title{Expected Value of the Half-t Distribution}
\usage{
EXhalft(alpha = 25, nu = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{numeric; scale parameter. Must be positive. Default is 25.}

\item{nu}{numeric; degrees of freedom parameter. Must be greater than 1
for the expected value to be finite. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
The expected value of the half-t distribution. Returns \code{Inf}
when \code{nu <= 1}, as the expected value does not exist in this case.
}
\description{
Calculate the expected value (mean) of the half-t distribution.
}
\details{
The expected value of the half-t distribution is given by:
\deqn{E[X] = 2\alpha\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{\pi}} \frac{\Gamma((\nu+1)/2)}{\Gamma(\nu/2)(\nu-1)}}
for \eqn{\nu > 1}. When \eqn{\nu \leq 1}, the expected value is infinite.
}
\examples{
# Expected value with default parameters (returns Inf since nu = 1)
EXhalft()

# Expected value with nu > 1
EXhalft(alpha = 10, nu = 5)

# Verify with simulation
set.seed(123)
mean(rhalft(10000, alpha = 10, nu = 5))
EXhalft(alpha = 10, nu = 5)
